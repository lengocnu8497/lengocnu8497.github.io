                                    <h2><strong>PROBLEM</strong></h2>
                                    <p>More than half of Cal Poly Pomona students are commuters, which makes parking a <b>painful</b> ritual that we all have to endure everyday before coming to class. Speaking from my own experience, there are days I had to drive back and forth between the school's three parking lots for <b>an hour and a half </b> to find an empty parking slot. That is not to mention about the <b>45-minutes drive</b> from my house to the school.<br><br>
                                    I'm sure that I'm not the only one who is super irritated about this nuiance. And of course, keep on complaining about how bad the parking situation is won't make it any better either, so I thought <b>let's do something about it.</b></p>

									<h2><strong>OUR IDEA</strong></h2>
                                        <p>The team and I had a 20 minutes brainstorming about how the layout would look like. <i>Do we need to add a user profile page? Is a nav bar necessary? Will a transition menu be a good option if the user wants to use the app while driving? How are we going to simplify the different categories of parking types for students, residents, and faculty/staffs?</i> Several questions came up as we formed our thoughts.<br><br>
                                        We took turns to sketched up our ideas on the board. The goal was to come up with a design where it suits the user needs as well as is simple enough so that any one can navigate through it. </p>

                                     <p>From the initial sketch, we solidified our goal - we were to create a mobile app where we can help college students reduce the time it takes to find parking on and off campus.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> An app that solves the parking complications on campus</li>
                                        <li> Keeps track of how many parking spots are available in each parking lot on and off campus that students/staff have access to</li>
                                        <li> User can spend less time looking for a spot since they will already know where the open spots are located</li>

                                     <p>   
                                        <span class="image left" ><img src="images/hiFiMockup1.JPG" alt="parking app low fidelity mock up" /></span> <br><br>
                                        During the first 2 weeks, I created the first version of high fidelity mockup. Our mentor, Denise Tran, recommended that we use Figma to build our wireframe. Having no experience in building a wireframe before, it was a huge learning curve for me to learn <b>how to use Figma and create the frame it self</b> based off our sketch. My goal at this stage was just to transfer evrything we had on the board onto Figma canvas. So I didn't pay much attention to <b>aesthetically pleasing the user</b>. After our first checkin, Denise commented that the design was too <b>bulky</b> looking, which gives a very <b>heavy</b> feel to it. This actually took away the <b>friendly element</b> that I wanted to present to the student users.
                                    </p>

                                        Acknowledging the feedbacks, I thnd version of high fidelity mockup. After a round of user survey with 10 participants, collected data suggested that our design was too bulky and the color was not pleasant on the eye. As a result, we decided to redesign the whole layout with softer look and better color scheme so that it is easy on the eye of the users.
                                    </p>
